## Introduction

Handwritten digit recognition is a common problem in machine learning and computer vision. This project utilizes the MNIST dataset to build and evaluate models that can classify handwritten digits. The project explores different algorithms and compares their performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dhanish-dhani/handwritten-digit-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd handwritten-digit-prediction
    ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the `Hand Written Digit Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to train the model, make predictions, and evaluate performance.
3. You can modify the notebook to test different models or tweak the existing ones.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles loading, normalizing, and reshaping of the MNIST dataset.
- **Model Training**: Includes multiple models (SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks) for comparison.
- **Evaluation**: Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual representation of predictions and model performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for development.
- **scikit-learn**: For model training, evaluation, and performance metrics.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: For data manipulation and handling.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for code execution and visualization.
